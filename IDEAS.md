## 🧠 v2.0 – Vector-Powered Personal Knowledge Base

🔹 Goal:
Transform the tool into a lightweight, local, AI-powered file intelligence system that builds a semantic memory of your computer — enabling search, navigation, organization, and insight.

📦 Core Concepts

1. Persistent Vector Memory
   Continuously embed and index files (names, contents, metadata) into a local vector DB (e.g., Quadrant)

Maintain a semantic map of your filesystem

Automatically update as files are added/removed/changed

2. Semantic Search
   Ask natural-language queries like:
   "invoice for crypto tax" → returns kraken_2024_invoice.pdf

Full-text + meaning-based search over all indexed files

3. File Relationships & Clustering
   Show similar or related files based on embeddings

Suggest implicit groupings: "these files look like they belong to the same project"

Semantic cross-folder links

4. Local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
   Ask questions like:

“What have I written about Chinese philosophy?”

Pulls relevant content from your files and uses LLM to summarize

5. Behavior Learning & Feedback
   Learn from your past actions (folder naming, cluster decisions)

Few-shot or in-context prompting from your personal history

Configurable preferences: “I like date-based naming” → adapt naming strategy

6. Timeline / Memory View
   View files and changes chronologically, semantically grouped

Like a time-based knowledge journal or digital memory stream

🛠 Optional Explorations
Audio/video transcription + embedding

OCR for PDFs/images

CLIP-based image similarity

Offline-compatible LLMs (GGUF, Ollama fine-tunes)

Encrypted storage for secure local memory
